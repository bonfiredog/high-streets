# spider-streets
#### _Printable street names for the linear communities of spiders that gather at the junction of your ceiling and wall._

During one of the lockdowns, I spent a lot of time looking at the ceiling of my living room. [It must have been autumn](https://metro.co.uk/2022/08/23/sex-crazed-spiders-will-invade-uk-homes-this-autumn-17231453/), as all along the junction of the ceiling and the top of the walls were rows of house spiders, hanging pendulous and as insubstantial as their own webs, surrounded by dead fruitflies like thoughts. They seemed to mind each other's space, with at least two or three inches between each killing field: good neighbours, though keeping up with the Joneses. Each line of wall/ceiling looked, for all the world, like a street of kindly neighbours. 

Rather than making sourdough (my starter lost the evolutionary race after a week or so) or jogging, I decided my lockdown project would be injecting these little communities with some civic spirit. So I made some street names.

They are based on the most graphically-recognisable of English street signs, [those of the City of Westminster in London](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Street_signs_in_the_City_of_Westminster), but in the naming I tried to draw on the coziness of the nomenclature that I remember from my childhood, with an added predators zing. I've included the .psd template if you want to make your own, however. 

If you like, you can print these yourself: I used an online service to get a single photo-paper sheet delivered, then cut them out and stuck them in the corners of the living room, 

I stopped myself before I started making house names and numbers for each spider. THey had already died, or left, by this point. I'm writing this in late September, and hoping new tenants will move in to [street name], [street name] and [street name].
